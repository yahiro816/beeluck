# ## Memory Analyzer
# 
# When you run this notebook, the [Memory Analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/semantic-link-sempy/sempy.fabric?view=semantic-link-python#sempy-fabric-model-memory-analyzer) will show you memory/storage statistics about the objects in your semantic model (i.e. Tables, Columns, Hierarchies, Partitions, and Relationships). These statistics may be used to identify areas of performance optimization and memory reduction for your semantic model.
# 
# ### Powering this feature: Semantic Link
# This notebook leverages [Semantic Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/semantic-link-overview), a python library which lets you optimize Fabric items for performance, memory and cost. The "[model_memory_analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/semantic-link-sempy/sempy.fabric?view=semantic-link-python#sempy-fabric-model-memory-analyzer)" function used in this notebook is just one example of the useful [functions]((https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/semantic-link-sempy/sempy.fabric)) which Semantic Link offers.
# 
# You can find more [functions](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs#featured-scenarios) and [helper notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs/tree/main/notebooks) in [Semantic Link Labs](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs), a Python library that extends Semantic Link's capabilities to automate technical tasks.
# 
# ### Low-code solutions for data tasks
# You don't have to be a Python expert to use Semantic Link or Semantic Link Labs. Many functions can be used simply by entering your parameters and running the notebook.


# MARKDOWN ********************

# #### Import the Semantic Link library

# CELL ********************

# Ensure semantic-link>=0.9.3 is installed
from packaging.version import Version
